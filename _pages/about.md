## About Me

I am a second-year M.S. student in Psychology at Arizona State University, advised by [Dr. Ben Falandays](https://jbfalandays.com/). My academic background is in physics and complex systems, and my research interest is on the intersection of cognitive science, Bayesian Learning, and network science.

## Research Focus

My work investigates the co-evolution of language, culture, and social networks through agent-based modeling and Bayesian approaches to learning and communication.  
I develop large-scale simulations to examine how communicative success, category structure, and patterns of social connectivity interact to shape cultural dynamics.

I welcome opportunities for collaboration, discussion, or questions so feel free to [contact me via email](mailto:asarkabo@asu.edu).


<!-- In addition to modeling, I work on multimodal data projects, including **social media analysis of wealth perception** and **network-based models of cultural specialization and alignment**.  
Broadly, my goal is to advance our understanding of how **communication processes and social structures jointly produce collective intelligence**. -->
