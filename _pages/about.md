## About Me

I am a second-year **M.S. student in Psychology at Arizona State University**, advised by [Dr. Ben Falandays](https://jbfalandays.com/).  
My background is in **physics and complex systems**, and my research lies at the intersection of **computational cognitive science, cultural evolution, and network science**.

## Research Focus

I study the **co-evolution of language, culture, and social networks** using agent-based modeling and Bayesian approaches to learning and communication.  
My simulations explore how **communicative success, category structure, and social connectivity** interact over time to shape cultural patterns.

I also work on multimodal data projects, including **social media analysis** (wealth cues on Instagram) and **network-based models of cultural specialization and alignment**.  
The broader goal of my work is to understand how **communication dynamics and social structure co-create collective intelligence**.
